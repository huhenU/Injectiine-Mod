::INJECTIINE v1.23 MOD::
::::::::::::::::::::::::

Injectiine is a Wii U VC batch injector by CatmanFan (Mod by huhen)

==PROCESS OF INJECTING==
Step 1: Put your rom into the "Files" directory
Step 2: Create/Get images for the game
	-bootTvTex.png (banner when the game starts)     [1280x720]
	-iconTex.png (icon of the game in the home menu) [128x128]
Step 3: Open the Injectiine file and follow the instructions

	In case you are trying to inject a game, but no base is good for it, you can use a custom base:
		-Dump a VC-Game of the console you want to inject
		-Put the code,content,meta folders into a folder named "Base"
		-Put the "Base" folder into the Files directory

	If you are doing a N64 Inject, but can't get it to work, a custom config.ini can help.
		-Just put a custom config.ini into the Files directory
