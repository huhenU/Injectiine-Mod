This is a mod of the Wiiu-VC-Injector "Injectiine",         
It has some features/fixes that the original one does not have. The moment the first release will come out, it will have:   
        
-Rewritten readme.txt      
-Corrected readme.txt           
-No longer deletes files when injects created             
-More information on when to chose what base and why           
-More information to make it easier to use for un-experienced users       
              
Keep in mind, that I'm NOT going to update this readme for every release. For release-notes for the latest release, please look in the "releases" section, or the "Changelog.txt"
