Why?
->Why not.

Again, this might not even work without editing a config yet.

v0.1b-1.23 (21/10/18)
-Fixed Typo in Console selection
-Fixed NES-Injection

Again, this might not even work without editing a config yet.

v0.1-1.23 (20/10/18)
Initial release, having everything I wanted to implement in the first release. A list of these features can be found below:

-Fixed GBA-Inject-option which would break when selecting a base
-Added notes on when to pick which base
-Revamped readme.txt
-No file deletions after injecting anymore, so you don't lose your rom/image files
-Added more information to make Injectiine easier to use for un-experienced users
-Removed false information

Keep in mind, that the NES-Injection may not work in this release. This is either a problem with my rom/base or Injectiine itself, but not my modded injector. I can surely say that, since I tried it on the unmodded Injector and I got the same error.
A few more Bugs that are coming from Injectiine itself, are also not fixed in this release, but they were too minor for me to fix them here.
That's why this is marked as a pre-release. If I get around to fixing these bugs, this will get it's first real release.

I can say: Everything that worked in unmodded Injectiine still works in this one (at least when I did my testing good). If I did it bad, it won't even work without editing a config.
